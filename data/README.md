# Data

The zipped folder data.zip contains the grids generated for our experiments using the script generate_grid.py .
The data is divided according to the corpus (e.g. Switchboard, AMI etc.).
In the folder for each corpus there is:
 - one subfolder for each configuration used to generate the grids (e.g. egrid_-coref etc.), containing all grids in .csv format
 - the file "Train_Validation_Test_split.csv" containing the splits used in our experiments for that corpus
